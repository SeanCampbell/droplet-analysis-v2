## Key Issues Identified from Ground Truth vs V1

### Frame 0000 Analysis:
**Ground Truth:**
- Droplet 1: center=(865, 862), radius=315
- Droplet 2: center=(1371, 455), radius=283

**V1 Detection:**
- Droplet 1: center=(1360, 498), radius=149
- Droplet 2: center=(864, 890), radius=149

**Issues:**
1. **Radius too small**: V1 detects ~149px radius vs ground truth ~300px radius
2. **Position accuracy**: Generally close but not perfect
3. **Scale detection**: V1 finds "200 µm" vs ground truth "100 µm"

## Iteration Plan
