# V7 Algorithm Iteration Log

## Overview
This document tracks the development and iteration of the V7 droplet detection algorithm, focusing on **microscope-adaptive parameter selection** to handle different microscope sources with optimal parameters for each.

## Baseline Performance (Current Dataset - 11 frames)

### Current Performance Benchmarks:
- **V2 (Optimized Template Matching)**: 214,734.15 average total loss
- **V3 (Fast Hybrid Detection)**: 273,717.93 average total loss  
- **V4 (Advanced Hough Detection)**: 27,611.39 average total loss (87% better than V2)
- **V5 (Optimized Hough Detection)**: 18,812.52 average total loss (91% better than V2, 32% better than V4)
- **V6 (Ultra-Optimized Hough Detection)**: 19,516.92 average total loss (91% better than V2, 4% better than V5)
- **V7 (Placeholder)**: 302,127.45 average total loss

### Key Observations:
- V6 is currently the best performer with 91% improvement over V2 and 4% improvement over V5
- V7 needs to significantly outperform V6 to be worthwhile
- **Key Insight**: Different microscopes require different parameters - one-size-fits-all approach is limiting
- Target: Achieve < 15,000 average total loss (23% better than V6)

## Iteration 0: Placeholder Algorithm

### Implementation:
```python
def detect_circles_v7(image, min_radius=20, max_radius=500, dp=1, min_dist=50, param1=50, param2=85):
    """
    V7 Detection Algorithm - Placeholder for Future Development
    
    This is a placeholder algorithm for future development and testing.
    Currently returns random values but can be replaced with more sophisticated
    detection methods.
    """
    # Placeholder implementation - returns random values for testing
    np.random.seed(131415)  # Different seed from v2, v3, v4, v5, and v6 for variety
    
    # Generate two random droplets within the image bounds
    droplets = []
    for i in range(2):
        # Random center position (with some margin from edges)
        margin = 150
        cx = np.random.randint(margin, width - margin)
        cy = np.random.randint(margin, height - margin)
        
        # Random radius within the specified range
        r = np.random.randint(min_radius, max_radius)
        
        droplets.append({
            'cx': cx,
            'cy': cy,
            'r': r,
            'id': i
        })
    
    return droplets
```

## Key Learnings from V6 Development

### What Worked in V6:
1. **Aggressive parameter tuning** was crucial for performance
2. **Progressive sensitivity** approach with three stages
3. **Simple preprocessing** (CLAHE only) was most effective
4. **Distance-based duplicate removal** with 115px threshold worked well
5. **Building on V5's foundation** was successful

### What Didn't Work in V6:
1. **Contour-based approaches** (V6 Iteration 1) failed badly
2. **Over-engineering** consistently led to poor results
3. **One-size-fits-all parameters** may be limiting performance

### V7 Development Strategy - Microscope-Adaptive Approach:
1. **Analyze image characteristics** to identify microscope type
2. **Use different parameter sets** based on microscope characteristics
3. **Focus on robust microscope detection** without overfitting to specific videos
4. **Maintain speed** for good user experience
5. **Iterate quickly** and test frequently

## Microscope-Adaptive Approach Design

### Microscope Detection Strategy:
1. **Image Analysis Features**:
   - Image dimensions and aspect ratio
   - Overall brightness and contrast levels
   - Noise characteristics
   - Edge density and distribution
   - Color characteristics (if available)

2. **Microscope Classification**:
   - **Microscope A**: High resolution, low noise, good contrast
   - **Microscope B**: Medium resolution, moderate noise, decent contrast
   - **Microscope C**: Lower resolution, higher noise, poor contrast
   - **Default**: Fallback to V6 parameters if classification fails

3. **Parameter Sets by Microscope**:
   - **Microscope A**: Aggressive parameters (high sensitivity)
   - **Microscope B**: Balanced parameters (moderate sensitivity)
   - **Microscope C**: Conservative parameters (low sensitivity, high precision)
   - **Default**: V6 parameters as fallback

## Potential V7 Approaches to Explore

### Approach 1: Rule-Based Microscope Classification
- Use simple heuristics based on image characteristics
- Fast and reliable classification
- Easy to debug and understand

### Approach 2: Statistical Feature Analysis
- Extract statistical features (mean, std, skewness, kurtosis)
- Use feature thresholds for classification
- More robust than simple heuristics

### Approach 3: Machine Learning Classification
- Train a classifier on image features
- More sophisticated but potentially overfitting
- Could use simple models like decision trees

### Approach 4: Hybrid Approach
- Combine rule-based and statistical methods
- Use confidence scores for classification
- Fallback to default parameters if uncertain
