- **Strategy**: Use V8's approach for microscope_1, optimize parameters for microscope_2
- Target: Achieve < 18,000 average total loss (improvement over V8)

### Microscope_2 Performance Analysis (Frames 7-9):
- **frame_0007.jpeg**: V3 loss = 183,219.49, V8 loss = 35,611.31 (V8 is 80.6% better)
- **frame_0008.jpeg**: V3 loss = 148,772.86, V8 loss = 17,888.72 (V8 is 88.0% better)  
- **frame_0009.jpeg**: V3 loss = 156,891.65, V8 loss = 21,334.40 (V8 is 86.4% better)

**V8 is already performing much better than V3 on microscope_2 frames, but there's still room for improvement.**

## Key Learnings from V8 Development

### What Worked in V8:
1. **Sophisticated V3 selection** was crucial for performance
2. **V3 for excellent frames** worked well for frames 0, 2, 3
3. **V7 for other frames** provided good baseline performance
4. **Microscope classification** correctly identified the two microscopes

### What V9 Will Focus On:
1. **Microscope_2 optimization** - frames 7-9 specifically
2. **Parameter tuning** for high brightness, high edge density frames
3. **Progressive sensitivity** optimization for challenging frames
4. **Targeted evaluation** on frames 7-9 only

### V9 Development Strategy:
1. **Use V8's approach for microscope_1** (frames 0-3, 10-13)
2. **Optimize parameters for microscope_2** (frames 7-9)
3. **Focus evaluation on frames 7-9** to measure improvement
4. **Iterate quickly** on parameter combinations
5. **Test frequently** to avoid overfitting

## Microscope_2 Characteristics (Frames 7-9)

### Image Features:
- **Brightness**: 0.713 - 0.747 (high)
- **Contrast**: 0.190 - 0.200 (high)
- **Edge Density**: 0.010 - 0.013 (high)
- **Noise**: 0.049 - 0.052 (moderate)
- **Texture Uniformity**: 0.007 (low)

### V3 Performance Issues:
- V3 struggled with high brightness and edge density
- V3's parameters (minDist=80, param1=45, param2=55) were too aggressive
- V3's radius range (250-350) may not be optimal for these frames

### V8 Performance (Current Baseline):
- V8 already performs much better than V3 on these frames
- V8 uses V7's microscope_c parameters for microscope_2
- Room for further optimization
