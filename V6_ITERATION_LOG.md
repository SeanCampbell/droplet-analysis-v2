## Iteration 0: Placeholder Algorithm

### Implementation:
```python
def detect_circles_v6(image, min_radius=20, max_radius=500, dp=1, min_dist=50, param1=50, param2=85):
    """
    V6 Detection Algorithm - Placeholder for Future Development
    
    This is a placeholder algorithm for future development and testing.
    Currently returns random values but can be replaced with more sophisticated
    detection methods.
    """
    # Placeholder implementation - returns random values for testing
    np.random.seed(101112)  # Different seed from v2, v3, v4, and v5 for variety
    
    # Generate two random droplets within the image bounds
    droplets = []
    for i in range(2):
        # Random center position (with some margin from edges)
        margin = 150
        cx = np.random.randint(margin, width - margin)
        cy = np.random.randint(margin, height - margin)
        
        # Random radius within the specified range
        r = np.random.randint(min_radius, max_radius)
        
        droplets.append({
            'cx': cx,
            'cy': cy,

## Key Learnings from V5 Development

### What Worked in V5:
1. **Fine-tuned parameters** were crucial for performance
2. **Progressive sensitivity** approach with three stages
3. **Simple preprocessing** (CLAHE only) was most effective
4. **Distance-based duplicate removal** with 110px threshold worked well
5. **Building on V4's foundation** was successful

### What Didn't Work in V5:
1. **Hybrid approaches** (V5 Iteration 1) didn't improve performance
2. **Complex preprocessing** (V5 Iteration 2) made things much worse
3. **Over-engineering** consistently led to poor results

### V6 Development Strategy:
1. **Start with V5's successful approach** as a foundation
2. **Explore new techniques** that could improve upon V5:
   - Contour-based detection with circularity analysis
   - Advanced edge detection methods
   - Machine learning approaches (if feasible)
   - Multi-scale template matching
   - Adaptive parameter selection based on image characteristics
3. **Focus on edge cases** where V5 might struggle
4. **Maintain speed** for good user experience
5. **Iterate quickly** and test frequently
